# PortofolioWebsite
Overview

This repository contains my personal Web Portfolio ‚Äî a static website showcasing my projects, certifications, and professional background as a C++ Software Developer and Network Infrastructure Enthusiast.

The website is deployed on AWS, containerized with Docker, and automatically built and deployed via GitHub Actions.
Infrastructure is fully managed using Terraform, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

Infrastructure Overview:

Terraform provisions the following AWS resources:

VPC with public and private subnets

Internet Gateway and public routing

Security Groups allowing inbound HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22 from your IP)

EC2 Instance (t2.micro) running Ubuntu 22.04 with Nginx

Elastic IP bound to the EC2 instance

Route 53 Hosted Zone and DNS records for domain and www subdomain

IAM Role for EC2 to pull images from ECR

Key Pair for SSH access


Setup & Deployment
1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites

Terraform

AWS CLI

Docker

AWS account with access keys

Registered domain in Route53 (or imported one)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/FlorinMilu/WebPortfolio.git
cd WebPortfolio

3Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker Image
docker build -t webportfolio:latest .


(Optional) Run locally:

docker run -d -p 8080:80 webportfolio:latest


Then open http://localhost:8080


4Ô∏è‚É£ Provision AWS Infrastructure

Initialize and apply Terraform:

terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve


Required Terraform variables:

terraform apply \
  -var="access_key=YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY" \
  -var="secret_key=YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY" \
  -var="ssh_public_key=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)" \
  -var="domain_name=yourdomain.com" \
  -var="email=you@example.com" \
  -var="docker_image=YOUR_ECR_IMAGE_URI"

5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure DNS

Terraform automatically creates Route53 records pointing your domain (@ and www) to your Elastic IP.
Wait for DNS propagation, then access your website.

6Ô∏è‚É£ CI/CD via GitHub Actions

The workflow .github/workflows/docker-image.yml automatically:

Builds the Docker image on every push to main

Optionally pushes the image to ECR (if configured)

Can be extended to trigger Terraform Apply via GitHub Actions

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build . -t webportfolio:latest
